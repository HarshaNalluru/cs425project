The bolded lines are the most critical for me. I’m already a checklist and
execution machine. It’s easy to obsess over pushing the ball forward as
a type-A personality, which leads to being constantly future-focused.
If anxiety is a focus on the future, practicing appreciation, even for 2 to
3 minutes, is counter-balancing medicine. The 5MJ forces me to think
about what I have, as opposed to what I’m pursuing.

When you answer “I am grateful for . . . ,” I recommend considering four
different categories. Otherwise, you will go on autopilot and repeat
the same items day after day (e.g., “my healthy family,” “my loving
dog,” etc.). I certainly did this, and it defeats the purpose. What are
you grateful for in the below four categories? I ask myself this every
morning as I fill out the 5MJ, and I pick my favorite three for that day:
An old relationship that really helped you, or that you valued
highly.
An opportunity you have today. Perhaps that’s just an opportunity
to call one of your parents, or an opportunity to go to work. It
doesn’t have to be something large.

Something great that happened yesterday, whether you
experienced or witnessed it.
Something simple near you or within sight. This was a
recommendation from Tony Robbins. The gratitude points
shouldn’t all be “my career” and other abstract items. Temper
those with something simple and concrete􏰀—􏰀a beautiful cloud
outside the window, the cof- fee that you’re drinking, the pen that
you’re using, or whatever it might be.
