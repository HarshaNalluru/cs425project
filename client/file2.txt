In 2011 in Toronto, I chanced upon a former monk named Dandapani
(Dandapani.org) at an event called Mastermind Talks. I was going
through a very scattered period in my life and felt like my energy was
traveling a millimeter outward in a million directions. For grounding, he
convinced me to start making my bed.

If a monk with three dots on his forehead is too much for you, I
would say first: Open your mind, you savage. Second, I would quote
legendary Naval Admiral William McRaven, who has commanded at
every level within the Special Operations community, including acting
as head of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) during the Osama
bin Laden raid. From his University of Texas at Austin commencement
speech:

“If you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the
first task of the day. It will give you a small sense of pride, and it will
encourage you to do another task and another and another. By the end
of the day, that one task completed will have turned into many tasks
completed. Making your bed will also reinforce the fact that little things
in life matter.”

What is “making your bed” to me? I use the sweep-it-under-the-rug
ap- proach. The goal is visual tidiness, not Four Seasons. I don’t tuck
in the sheets. I have a large blanket or duvet, and I’ll use that to cover
the sheets, smoothing it out. Then, I place the pillows symmetrically
underneath or on top of the blanket, and I’m done. That’s it. It’s very
simple. If you work from home, this serves double duty, especially if
you work in or near your bedroom. If you see an external distraction
(speaking personally), you end up creating an internally distracted state.
