Problems that are present in current Networks code

* Specified no. of rounds in the game after that the game completes and shows the penalty of each pariticipant. or '#stop' to stop the game at the client, then server sends all the scores to each client
* clock ticking and penalty deciding.(send scores to the server along with the word, server stores them in scores.txt)
* last-letter is the begining of the new word (client side word check before sending to server and client gets another chance if the word doesn't satisfy the criteria)
* non-repition of words (client side - map)
* Input should not be accepted if it is not that client's turn.
